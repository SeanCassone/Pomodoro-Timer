# Pomodoro Timer

## Context
This application is a time-management application based on a method developed by Francesco Cirillo in the late 1980s. The technique uses a timer to break down work into intervals, traditionally 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks.

## Discoveries
The Pomodor timer is the first application I coded in react. It was very diffucult learning how state works in React. I did however manage to get through it an learned all about React State in the process.

## Future goals for this project
I intened on adding the ability to be able to save a preset timer.
